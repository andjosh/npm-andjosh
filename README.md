npm-andjosh
===

I wanted a slightly more unique job application.

Also, a fun little game never hurts.

## Usage

```sh
$ npm andjosh   // conveys some thoughts
$ npm boom      // kills some time
```

## Installation

```sh
$ npm i npm-andjosh -g
```

## Uninstallation

```sh
$ npm uninstall npm-andjosh -g
```

This will clean things up.
